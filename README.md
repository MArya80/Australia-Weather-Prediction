# Australia-Weather-Prediction

In this Project, I trained 3 different model which have at least 85% accuracy. The model should predict whether is it going to rain the next day coming or it isn't.
The models that have been deployed were ***TensorFlow Sequential, Random Forest Classifier and GradientBoostingClassifier***. The best model on both training and test set was achieved with ***Gradient Boosting Classifier*** with *95.2%* and *85.5%* *accuracy* on train and test set respectively.
